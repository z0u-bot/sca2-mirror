    We add fallback control: a training term that teaches the blocks what to answer once the concept is gone, aiming at a designed fallback answer, with the concept's placement kept out of its gradient. Does the fallback appear, does the intervention stay effective and selective, and does seed variability fall?
    The fallback appears in every seed, costs nothing on the task and a little margin, and reaches the plain projection at more than half strength. The reflection it was trained at is destructive on non-red lines in every anchored model, with or without the term.

    ## Findings

    - [The designed response (H1)](#the-designed-response-h1) — **holds.** Fallback accuracy on the red lines with a clean visible operand under `redirect`: {_fb:.3f}, against {_fb_ref:.3f} without the term; gate {ex.FALLBACK_ACC_GATE:g}, and the margin above the reference clears the {floor("redirect", "fb_acc", "red_clean"):.3f} floor.
    - [Task and placement intact (H2)](#task-and-placement-intact-h2) — **holds.** Clean accuracy gap from the no-fallback condition: {_gap:.4f} (gate {ex.TASK_GATE:g}). Margin at the end of training: {_ratio:.3f} of the no-fallback value (gate {ex.MARGIN_RATIO:g}).
    - [Selectivity kept (H3)](#selectivity-kept-h3) — **partial.** Non-red deficit under `redirect`: {_d_red:.3f} (gate {ex.TASK_GATE:g}; the no-fallback condition loses {_d_red_ref:.3f} under the same edit). Under `projection`: {_d_proj:.3f} against {_d_proj_ref:.3f}, a difference under the {floor("projection", "deficit", "nonred"):.3f} floor, so the second clause holds as unresolved.
    - [Transfer from the antipode to zero (H4)](#transfer-from-the-antipode-to-zero-h4) — **holds.** Fallback accuracy at γ = 1 is {_g[1] / _g[3]:.2f} of its value at γ = 2 (gate {ex.TRANSFER_FRAC:g}), and the sweep has no dip.

    The hypotheses, their gates, and the method were frozen at commit `d72340e7`, before any run. Each hypothesis section opens with that frozen prediction, and its results follow in place. Two corrections landed after the freeze, each with a `REVIEW` note beside the text it changed: the count of red lines with a clean visible operand (296, from 298; one color sat on the 0.5 contour to roundoff), and the gradient paragraph in the method, which now accounts for the tied embedding. Anything conceived after seeing the data is under [Exploratory analyses](#exploratory-analyses), marked as post hoc. The [Discussion](#discussion) is still a placeholder, pending a discussion round.
    ///

    ## Why this experiment

    [Ex-2.2.1](../ex-2.2.1/report.py) showed that projecting the anchor axis out of the D2.1 checkpoints suppresses *red*. Red-line accuracy falls from 1.0 to 0.09, in proportion to how red the line is, and stays inside the bound the placed geometry set.

    It also measured what the model does instead. A red line still decodes to a color, about half the time a one-step neighbor of the true mix, and which neighbor it is varies by seed: at least five of the nine seeds agree on 13% of red lines. Nothing in training said what a removed concept should decode to, so the answer is whatever the untrained region of the stream happens to produce. M1 called that spoofing, and it is where the seed spread in [ex-2.9.1](/docs/m1/ex-2.9.1/report.py) came from.

    The remedy in M1 was fallback control ([ex-2.9.2](/docs/m1/ex-2.9.2/report.py)): one loss term, applied to the decoder only, that pins the antipode of the anchor axis to a designed null answer, mid-gray. Reflecting a state through the axis then collapsed the response to a tight cluster on the bound the null predicted, across 32 seeds. Under plain zeroing the term added little, and that report said a trained fallback should be paired with the redirect it was trained at.

    Here we bring the term into the transformer, keeping the D2.1 grammar and recipe. This comes before the operation work in the [D2.2 plan](../d2.2/design.md) changes the grammar.

    The term is one loss, but it touches the model in three places:
    the edit at the embedding, where every position is reflected through the axis and then held fixed;
    the loss, read at the `=` position of each red line;
    the gradient, which reaches the four blocks and the readout, and stops at the reflected states, so it cannot move the placement.
    <!-- REVIEW: this line said the gradient reaches "the unembedding but not the embedding"; the two are one table in nGPT, so it now says what the detach cuts. The method's "Where the term acts" paragraph carries the full note. -->

    In M1 the decoder took a constant input, the antipode itself, so the term was decoder-only by construction. Here a stop-gradient[^sg] gives the reflected state that same role.

    [^sg]: An identity in the forward pass with a gradient of zero (`.detach()` in PyTorch), so a loss downstream of it cannot move anything upstream of it. The other losses see the clean pass and are unaffected.

    The fallback answer for a continuous concept also has to be chosen. We use the center of the operand-averaged null, which works out to be the visible operand mixed with *mid-gray*; the [method](#the-fallback-answer) derives it.

    This addresses the third risk in the plan, that the response to suppression is undesigned. One mismatch carries over from M1: the response is trained at the antipode, while the ex-2.2.1 projection lands the state at zero. H4 measures how far the response transfers between the two.

    The nearest published analogue is LUNAR (arXiv:2502.07218): one matrix edit after training, redirecting the activations of the data to forget into the model's own refusal region. LUNAR designs the response by choosing a region the model already produces; ours is trained at a state the model never otherwise visits, which is where the mismatch above comes from. E6 fits a LUNAR-style edit to the no-fallback checkpoints, so the two designs can be compared.

    **Natural language.** The three parts all transfer to the natural language domain:
    the edit would be the reflection at the first anchored slice, applied at every position;
    the loss would be computed on the continuation (the tokens of the response), rather than at one `=` position;
    the gradient stops before the edit.
    The edit happens based on alignment of the states to the anchor, so it's grammar-agnostic and token labels are not needed.

    The fallback answer still has to be chosen; some candidates:
    **(a)** a template continuation, so the training data is pairs of context and designed response;
    **(b)** the model's own refusal region, which is the LUNAR choice (and which could be anchored separately);
    **(c)** a true null, the continuation a reference model gives when it has never seen the concept, matched with a KL term.[^kl]

    Spoofing in that setting is confabulation: a plausible answer drawn from the neighbors of the concept. The *mid-gray* answer here is a trained abstention that keeps the model on task (rather than, say, emitting a syntax token like `+` or `=` where the answer should be). A natural language version would want that same property.

    [^kl]: A KL term penalizes the distance between the next-token distribution of the model and that of the reference.

    - **residual stream** — the running vector each token carries through the network, which every block reads from and writes to.
    - **slice** ($\ell$) — a depth at which the residual stream is read: the embedding (0), plus the stream after each of the four blocks.
    - **alignment** ($\alpha$) — $\cos(h, e_1)$, the cosine between a state and the anchor axis. States are unit-norm, so this is just the e₁ component.
    - **dose** — how *red* a line is, taken as the larger of the two operand rednesses ($r(1 - g/2 - b/2)$ on the unit cube).
    - **red lines** — dose ≥ 0.8. 365 probe lines. **Non-red lines** — dose ≤ 0.2. 1,689 lines.
    - **concept operand** — the redder of the two operands in a line (ties go to op1); the **visible operand** is the other one, and is *clean* when its redness is below 0.5.
    - **margin** (`m_span`) — the pooled alignment margin of ex-2.1.10: at each slice, how much more aligned the red states are than the rest, taken at the best span role, then averaged over slices.
    - **fallback answer** — the designed answer for a *red* line under intervention: the visible operand mixed with *mid-gray*, rounded to the grid. This is the center of the operand-averaged null.
    - **fallback accuracy** — the fraction of *red* lines whose argmax at `=` is the fallback answer.
    - **response** — the probability the model puts on the correct answer, read from the log-softmax at the `=` position. **Damage** is the clean response minus the intervened response, per line. **Deficit** is the clean exact-match accuracy minus the intervened accuracy over a group of lines; it is the statistic ex-2.2.1 gated selectivity on.
    - **seed agreement** — the fraction of *red* lines on which at least five of the nine seeds decode the same answer, under a given intervention.
    - **redirect** — reflecting the embedding state through the axis, α → −α, at every position. The edit at a position is twice its alignment, so a state with nothing on the axis does not move. This is the state the fallback was trained at.

    ## Conditions

    Two of the three conditions are ex-2.1.10 checkpoints already in the store, re-scored here through the same code path as the new runs. The third is trained here.

    | condition | training | seeds | source |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **un-anchored** | the recipe with the anchor weight at zero | 3 | ex-2.1.10 `lam0` |
    | **no-fallback** | the D2.1 recipe: anchor + anti-subspace term | 9 | ex-2.1.10 `either-t100` |
    | **fallback** | the recipe + anti-anchor term (0.1) + fallback term (w_fb = 0.05) | 9 | new |

    Every hypothesis scores against the fallback condition. The no-fallback condition is the reference for it under every intervention.

    The arms below have three seeds each. We report the same statistics for them, without gates.

    | arm | what changes | question |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `fb-only` | no anti-anchor term | does the fallback need the antipode hemisphere cleared for it? |
    | `anti-only` | no fallback term | does the anti-anchor term alone move the response? |
    | `fb-w0.01`, `fb-w0.25` | the fallback weight, a factor of five either side | is 0.05 on a plateau? |
    | `recipe` | both new weights at zero | does the new code path reproduce the ex-2.1.10 checkpoints? |

    ### The interventions

    All of these run through the projection operator of the eval contract: it removes a fraction γ of the e₁ component, then puts the state back on the sphere. At γ = 2 the operator is a reflection, flipping the component instead of shrinking it.

    - **`redirect`** — γ = 2 at the embedding, at every position, with no labels. This is the same edit training applied, so H1 reads the readout the term trained. Read by H1 and the first clause of H3.
    - **`projection`** — the ex-2.2.1 intervention: γ = 1 at every slice and every position. The fallback was never trained under it. Read by the second clause of H3 and the projection row of H4.
    - **The transfer sweep** — γ ∈ {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2} at the embedding, every position. Its γ = 2 point is `redirect`, and its γ = 1 point is the `embedding` arm of ex-2.2.1, which differs from `projection` in leaving the later slices alone. Read by H4.
    - **Ride-along rows** — the `operands`, `shaped`, and `ablate` arms from ex-2.2.1, run on the fallback condition without gates. That way the intervention-tuning pass in the design has the fallback rows to hand (E5). `operands` is the one row here that needs position labels; it stays so we can compare with ex-2.2.1.

    <!-- REVIEW: earlier drafts restricted `redirect` to operand positions, then to the concept operand of each line, to match a training term that reflected one state per line. Neither is an edit a model without labelled positions can run. Now `redirect` reflects every position at the embedding, training reflects the same, and the red lines with no defined fallback answer (a visible operand that is itself red) leave the term and the gate of H1 rather than the edit. Verify: the training paragraph in the method, and VISIBLE_RED_DOSE in experiment.py. -->

Seed-mean fallback accuracy over the red lines with a clean visible operand (296 of the 365) is at least 0.8; partial: between 0.5 and 0.8. The other 69 red lines have no defined fallback answer, so we report them beside the gated figure, unscored. The reference row is the no-fallback condition under the same intervention. The fallback figure has to sit above that reference by a resolved margin, meaning two pooled between-seed standard deviations. A figure that clears 0.8 without a resolved margin counts as partial. Contrary: fallback accuracy at the no-fallback level, which would mean the term did not train the readout. The fallback loss over training (see the method) says whether the term was ever active.

The no-fallback condition emits it on {_ref.mean():.3f}. The resolution floor for the statistic is {_floor:.3f}, so the margin above the reference is resolved. The probability the model puts on the fallback answer is {stat("redirect", "p_fb", "red_clean").mean():.3f} on average over seeds and lines, and the strip shows no split: every seed puts nearly every line at the top.

    Clean accuracy on all probe lines is {clean("acc", "all").mean():.3f} in the fallback condition against {clean("acc", "all", ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f} without the term, a gap of {_acc_gap:.4f} against a gate of {ex.TASK_GATE:g}. The margin at the end of training is {clean("m_span").mean():.3f} against {clean("m_span", cond=ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f}, a ratio of {_ratio:.3f} against a gate of {ex.MARGIN_RATIO:g}. Every fallback seed sits between {clean("m_span").min():.3f} and {clean("m_span").max():.3f}. The trajectories say where the margin went: the `fb-only` arm ends at {clean("m_span", cond="fb-only").mean():.3f} and the `anti-only` arm at {clean("m_span", cond="anti-only").mean():.3f}, so the loss of margin comes with the anti-anchor hinge, and the fallback term on its own costs none. The hinge also raises the mean alignment at op1, from {clean("alpha_mean_op1", cond=ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f} to {clean("alpha_mean_op1").mean():.3f}.

    The fallback loss switches on once the anchor has placed the concept, inside the warm-up, and reaches {trajectory("fallback")[:, -1].mean():.4f} by the end; in the `anti-only` arm, where it is measured and never trained, it stays at {trajectory("fallback", "anti-only")[:, -1].mean():.1f}. The anti-anchor hinge ends at {trajectory("anti_anchor")[:, -1].mean():.4f} where it is trained and {trajectory("anti_anchor", "fb-only")[:, -1].mean():.4f} where it is not.

    **H2 holds.** Both clauses clear their gates: the term costs nothing on the task, and the margin stays above {ex.MARGIN_RATIO:g} of the no-fallback value, with the part it does lose attributable to the hinge rather than to the fallback term.

    ## Selectivity kept (H3)

    **H3.** Under `redirect`, the seed-mean non-red deficit stays at or below 0.02. Under `projection`, the non-red deficit in the fallback condition is not resolved above the no-fallback figure (0.024 in ex-2.2.1, re-measured here).

    On a non-red line the operands have nearly nothing on the axis, so the first clause rests on the syntax embeddings. Zeroing their constant component is what cost the ex-2.2.1 projection its 0.024, and the reflection flips it instead. Training runs the reflected pass on every crop that carries a qualifying red line, so the blocks see flipped syntax states, and read them as syntax, throughout training. We predict that this transfers to the non-red lines the term never scored.

    Partial: the first clause holds only at the 0.05 band, or exactly one clause holds.

    Contrary on the first clause: a deficit at or above the ex-2.2.1 figure, which would say the flipped syntax reads as a different syntax, and would send the intervention-tuning pass toward a thresholded reflection, the `shaped` falloff at strength 2. Contrary on the second clause: the term widens the edit, which would mean the blocks now read the axis at positions or slices where they did not before.

    <!-- REVIEW: H3 (then H4) was written on non-red *damage*, the probability statistic. The 0.02 width and the 0.024 reference both come from ex-2.2.1's H2, which gated the accuracy *deficit* (its H2 line: "outside the 0.02 gate but inside the 0.05 partial gate"), so the gate and its reference were being read on a statistic they were not set for. Now stated on the deficit, with the same widths, and the partial band written out. Verify: ex-2.2.1's H2 section, and the "non-red deficit" column of its arms table.

    {_rows}

    Seed mean with the seed range. The deficit is the drop in exact-match accuracy on the {lines.nonred.sum()} non-red lines from the clean pass; damage is the drop in probability on the true answer.

    **First clause.** Under `redirect`, the fallback condition loses {_d_redirect.mean():.3f} of its non-red accuracy, with no seed under {_d_redirect.min():.3f}; the gate is {ex.TASK_GATE:g} and the partial band {ex.TASK_PARTIAL:g}. The reflection is no more selective without the term: the no-fallback condition loses {stat("redirect", "deficit", "nonred", ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f} under it, and the `recipe` arm {stat("redirect", "deficit", "nonred", "recipe").mean():.3f}. The un-anchored condition loses {stat("redirect", "deficit", "nonred", ex.CONTROL.name).mean():.3f}. So a full reflection of every embedding state is destructive on non-red lines in every anchored model, and the training-time exposure to flipped syntax states did not transfer to them. What those lines decode to is in the post-hoc row of the exploratory section.

    **Second clause.** Under `projection`, the fallback condition's non-red deficit is {_d_proj.mean():.3f} against {_d_proj_ref.mean():.3f} without the term, which is what ex-2.2.1 reported on the same checkpoints. The difference, {_d_proj.mean() - _d_proj_ref.mean():.3f}, sits under the resolution floor of {_floor_proj:.3f}, so by the frozen rule the deficit is not resolved above the reference. The floor is wide because both conditions spread over seeds: the fallback seeds run from {_d_proj.min():.3f} to {_d_proj.max():.3f}, the reference seeds from {_d_proj_ref.min():.3f} to {_d_proj_ref.max():.3f}. Damage tells the same story ({stat("projection", "damage", "nonred").mean():.3f} against {stat("projection", "damage", "nonred", ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f}, floor {floor("projection", "damage", "nonred"):.3f}). The weight bracket is the sharper reading: the deficit under `projection` rises with the weight, from {stat("projection", "deficit", "nonred", "fb-w0.01").mean():.3f} at 0.01 through {_d_proj.mean():.3f} at {ex.FALLBACK_WEIGHT:g} to {stat("projection", "deficit", "nonred", "fb-w0.25").mean():.3f} at 0.25.

    {_plot()}

    The write map shows no re-writing at any site: every deeper slice arrives at the operator at or below its clean alignment. Whatever the term changed under `projection`, it did not widen where the edit acts on the axis.

    **H3 is partial**, by the frozen rule that exactly one clause holds. The first clause fails outright and outside the partial band, which is the contrary case named above: the flipped syntax does not read as syntax.

    ## Transfer from the antipode to zero (H4)

    **H4.** The designed response transfers (generalizes) part of the way to zero. Along the transfer sweep, γ ∈ {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2} at the embedding, seed-mean fallback accuracy on red lines is non-decreasing in γ, allowing a dip of at most 0.02 between adjacent strengths, and at γ = 1 it is at least half its value at γ = 2. Partial: either clause holds on its own — monotone with γ = 1 below half, or γ = 1 at half or more with a dip larger than the allowance.

    The γ = 1 point is a real removal, not an inert midpoint. It is the `embedding` arm of ex-2.2.1, where zeroing the axis at the embedding alone took red accuracy down to 0.16. The sweep adds how the fallback responds along the way from the trained state to that one. At γ = 1 the operator keeps whatever the state carries off the axis and rescales it by $1/\sqrt{1-\alpha^2}$, so the landing direction is defined as long as the state is not perfectly aligned, and no state is: pure red arrives at the embedding at about α = 0.9, a gain of about 2.3.

    Contrary: fallback accuracy at γ = 1 sits at the no-fallback level and the rise is confined to γ > 1. That would be the mismatch showing in full, with the response living at the antipode and not reaching the projected state. The [concept swap](/todo/science/redirect-between-two-anchored-ops.md) filed for D2.3 would address it by targeting a state training already visits; widening the bracket here would not.

    <!-- REVIEW: H4's (then H5's) partial band covered only the monotone-but-short case, leaving no verdict for a run that transfers to γ = 1 through a dip; both single-clause cases are now partial. The D2.3 sentence was in the present indicative ("the remedy is"), which reads as a scheduled follow-up; softened to the conditional, since that item is a backlog entry. -->

    We report the `projection` row beside the sweep, without a gate: γ = 1 at every slice rather than at the embedding alone. The difference between the two says how much the projection at later slices costs the designed response.

    Along the sweep, the fallback condition's seed-mean fallback accuracy runs {", ".join(f"{v:.3f}" for v in _mean)} at γ = {", ".join(f"{g:g}" for g in ex.GAMMAS)}. It is non-decreasing (the largest drop between adjacent strengths is {max(_dip, 0):.3f}, against an allowance of {ex.GRADE_DIP:g}), and at γ = 1 it stands at {_half:.2f} of its value at γ = 2, against a gate of {ex.TRANSFER_FRAC:g}. The seed range at γ = 1 is wide, from {_g1.min():.2f} to {_g1.max():.2f}, and at γ = 1.5 every seed is above {_fb[ex.FALLBACK.name][2].min():.2f}. The no-fallback condition stays at {_fb[ex.NO_FALLBACK.name].mean(1).max():.3f} or below throughout. True-answer accuracy on red lines falls the same way in both conditions: the removal at γ = 1 is at least as complete with the term as without it ({_acc[ex.FALLBACK.name][1].mean():.3f} against {_acc[ex.NO_FALLBACK.name][1].mean():.3f}).

    The `projection` row, γ = 1 at every slice, gives {_proj.mean():.3f} ({_proj.min():.2f} to {_proj.max():.2f}), a little under the embedding-only figure at the same strength. Removing the axis at the later slices as well costs the designed response {_g1.mean() - _proj.mean():.3f} on the seed mean.

    **H4 holds.** The response reaches the projected state at more than half strength, and rises monotonically from there to the trained one. The contrary case, a rise confined to γ > 1, did not occur.

    ## Exploratory analyses

    Preregistered as exploratory, no gates, except the last row, which is post hoc.

    **E1 — composition.** {_plot()}

    Under `redirect`, the fallback condition decodes {_comp[(ex.FALLBACK.name, "redirect")][:, 0].sum() / _comp[(ex.FALLBACK.name, "redirect")].sum():.3f} of red lines to the fallback answer, and the mass outside the color vocabulary is {_offvocab.mean():.3f} (the no-fallback condition puts {_offvocab_ref.mean():.3f} of its mass outside it under the same edit, with a seed range from {_offvocab_ref.min():.2f} to {_offvocab_ref.max():.2f}). Under `projection` the fallback condition splits between the fallback answer and a one-step neighbor of the true mix, in a proportion that varies by seed.

    | condition | agree, `redirect` | plurality, `redirect` | agree, `projection` | plurality, `projection` |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    {_agree_rows}

    Seed agreement on the red lines with a clean visible operand. "Agree" is the fraction of lines on which at least {ex.AGREE_SEEDS} of the nine seeds decode the same answer, ex-2.2.1's statistic (which put it at 13% under the projection); it is undefined for the three-seed conditions. "Plurality" is the mean over lines of the fraction of seeds decoding the line's plurality answer, defined for every condition.

    **E2 — the antipode.** The fraction of clean states with negative alignment, per slice and averaged over positions:

    | condition | emb. | block 1 | block 2 | block 3 | block 4 | all |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    {_neg_rows}

    The anti-subspace term alone leaves about a quarter of clean states past the antipode plane; the hinge takes that to about {clean("negative_frac").mean():.2f}, and the `fb-only` arm, without the hinge, sits where the no-fallback condition does.

    **E3 — off-axis recoverability.** Held-out R² of a ridge probe for the concept operand's redness, fitted on the operand states with the axis deleted, per slice; fallback / no-fallback, with the resolution floor (two pooled between-seed sds) beside each:

    | states | emb. | block 1 | block 2 | block 3 | block 4 | floor: emb. | b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    {_r2_rows}

    The floor the task itself sets, the same ridge fit to the raw RGB values, is {metrics["rgb_floor"]:.3f}. Every figure is above it. Under `redirect` and under `projection`, the fallback condition's R² sits above the no-fallback condition's at the deeper slices by 0.03 to 0.05, under the floor at every slice. The [follow-up at more seeds](/todo/science/off-axis-probe-r2-does-bound-intervention.md) is where that would be resolved.

    **E4 — arms.** The tables under H1, H2, and H3 carry every arm. Dropping the hinge (`fb-only`) leaves the fallback under `redirect` intact and the margin at the no-fallback level, and takes the transfer to γ = 1 from {stat("gamma-1.0", "fb_acc", "red_clean").mean():.3f} to {stat("gamma-1.0", "fb_acc", "red_clean", "fb-only").mean():.3f}. Dropping the fallback term (`anti-only`) leaves no designed response. Along the weight bracket, transfer to γ = 1 rises with the weight ({stat("gamma-1.0", "fb_acc", "red_clean", "fb-w0.01").mean():.3f}, {stat("gamma-1.0", "fb_acc", "red_clean").mean():.3f}, {stat("gamma-1.0", "fb_acc", "red_clean", "fb-w0.25").mean():.3f}) and so does the non-red deficit under `projection` (H3's table). The `recipe` arm reproduces the stored no-fallback checkpoints through the new code path: margin {clean("m_span", cond="recipe").mean():.3f} against {clean("m_span", cond=ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f}, red accuracy under `projection` {stat("projection", "acc", "red", "recipe").mean():.3f} against {stat("projection", "acc", "red", ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f}, non-red deficit under `projection` {stat("projection", "deficit", "nonred", "recipe").mean():.3f} against {stat("projection", "deficit", "nonred", ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f}. The recomputed clean alignment maps of the stored runs match ex-2.1.10's published ones to {max(metrics["alpha_max_diff"].values()):.4f}.

    **E5 — ride-along interventions.**

    | intervention | condition | red acc. | fallback acc., clean visible | non-red deficit | non-red damage |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    {_ride_rows}

    The `operands` edit, at the operand positions only, keeps its selectivity in the fallback condition and produces the fallback answer on {stat("operands", "fb_acc", "red_clean").mean():.2f} of lines. `ablate` is the one row where the fallback condition differs from the reference by a large amount: it emits the fallback answer on about half the red lines and loses {stat("ablate", "deficit", "nonred").mean():.3f} of its non-red accuracy, against {stat("ablate", "deficit", "nonred", ex.NO_FALLBACK.name).mean():.3f} without the term.

    **E6 — a LUNAR-style redirect, fitted after training.** On each frozen no-fallback checkpoint we fit one 64×64 matrix at the embedding, applied at every position, on the qualifying red lines the fallback term uses, with two loss parts: the fallback cross-entropy at `=`, and an identity term on every other state (the mean squared distance from the unedited state). This model has no refusal region of its own, so the fallback answer stands in for it. The fitted matrix runs through the eval contract like any other operator, and gives fallback accuracy {seed_row(_lunar["fb_acc"])} on the red lines with a clean visible operand, red-line accuracy {seed_row(_lunar["acc"])}, a non-red deficit of {seed_row(_lunar["deficit"])}, and non-red damage of {seed_row(_lunar["damage"])}. Beside the fallback condition under `redirect` ({stat("redirect", "fb_acc", "red_clean").mean():.3f} and a deficit of {stat("redirect", "deficit", "nonred").mean():.3f}), the fitted edit reaches the same designed response at a smaller cost on non-red lines, with a wide seed spread. Its identity term was the only thing asking it to leave other positions alone, and at the weight used it did not do so.

    **E7 — non-red lines under the reflection (post hoc).** What the non-red lines decode to, as a fraction of (seed, line) pairs: the true answer, the fallback answer of the visible operand, the visible operand itself, or something else.

    | condition | true, `redirect` | fallback | visible | other | true, `projection` | fallback | visible | other |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    {_nonred_rows}

    Under `redirect`, the fallback condition emits the gray mix of the visible operand on {_nonred_split("redirect", ex.FALLBACK.name)[1]:.2f} of non-red (seed, line) pairs, so about a third of its loss on those lines is the designed response firing where no concept was removed; the rest, like the whole of the no-fallback condition's loss, is undesigned. Under `projection` the fallback fires on {_nonred_split("projection", ex.FALLBACK.name)[1]:.3f} of them, which is the size of the unresolved difference in H3's second clause.

    <!-- REVIEW: E7 is post hoc; it was added after the H3 result to say what the non-red lines decode to, using the per-line guesses the scorer already stores. The fallback answer for a non-red line is the scorer's own table (visible operand mixed with gray), with the true-answer and visible-operand coincidences removed first. Verify: the composition order in experiment.py, and the per-line `guess` arrays. -->

    Interpretation only, after the results. Whether the fallback in the transformer gives the intervention a designed outcome the way it did in M1. How far it transfers from the trained state to the projected one, and what that says the anchored-op experiments should train toward. Whether the anti-anchor term earns its place in the recipe. What the off-axis row says about masking, read against the [Most Forbidden Technique paragraph](../d2.2/design.md#fallback-control) in the design, and what the fitted edit of E6 says about designing at a region the model already has.

The [ex-2.1.11](../ex-2.1.11/report.py) survey proposed a different point. But survey numbers are proposals until they are re-measured at fresh seeds, and the design schedules that confirmation on the multi-op grammar. Keeping the ex-2.1.10 recipe also keeps its stored checkpoints as the no-fallback condition, so nothing has to be retrained for the comparison.

    We also use the same seeds as the primary of that experiment, so the fallback and no-fallback conditions differ only in the two new terms. Both are weights on the existing anchored train step.

    **The fallback term.** On each training crop, we reflect the embedding state of every position through the axis, $h \mapsto \mathrm{normalize}(h - 2\alpha\, e_1)$, and hold the reflected states fixed with a stop-gradient. We then run the blocks forward from there and take the cross-entropy at the `=` position of each qualifying line against its fallback token. A line qualifies on three counts: its dose is at least 0.8, the redness of its visible operand is below 0.5, and the clean embedding alignment of its concept operand is at least 0.5. The reflection singles out no positions, so it is the same edit `redirect` applies at eval, and it applies unchanged to a model whose positions are not labelled.

    **Compute.** The reflected pass is a second forward and backward through the blocks, so a step that carries a qualifying line costs about twice a plain step. A crop holds about ten lines, and about one line in twenty qualifies, so roughly 40% of crops carry one. Run per batch, that is nearly every step, and the budget below counts the term as a doubling. Three things should make it cheap at scale. The pass can be skipped when no position clears the alignment threshold, which the clean pass at the edit slice already reports, so it costs nothing before the anchor has placed the concept. It can run on a subsample of the qualifying sequences, or on every k-th step, since the term is a small weight on a slowly moving target. And it reruns only the part of the model after the edit, so an edit deeper than the embedding shares the earlier layers with the clean pass.

    The term is the mean over qualifying lines, at a constant weight of 0.05 from step 0. We take that weight from M1, as a starting point rather than a derived value: there it scaled a mean squared error on one decoder, and here it scales a cross-entropy through four blocks. Checking it is what the bracket arms are for.

    The alignment threshold keeps the term inert until the anchor has placed the concept, which the ex-2.1.10 trajectories put inside the warm-up. If the concept never arrived at the edit slice, the term would stay inert rather than train toward the wrong state, and the margin gate of H2 would report the anchoring failure.

    <!-- REVIEW: the frozen text said the embedding table gets no gradient from the term. nGPT ties the unembedding to the embedding table, so the table does see the term through the readout. Corrected to say what the detach does and does not cut; the design (reflect once, detach, train what follows) is unchanged. Verify: `reflected_logits` in src/sca/fallback.py multiplies by `wte.T`. -->
    **Where the term acts.** The stop-gradient makes this similar to the decoder-only term from M1: the reflected embedding states are detached, so nothing flows back through them to the placement of *red* at the edit, while the four blocks and the readout do learn. The readout is the embedding table itself, since nGPT ties the two, so the table sees the term through the readout only: the answer rows move toward the reflected pass's final state, and every other row, *red*'s included, moves a little away from it. That is a decoder-side nudge on the rows rather than a pull on where the concept sits, and the margin gate of H2 is where it would show. Together the blocks and the readout learn a map from a state at the antipode to the fallback answer. In ex-2.2.1 the concept was read from the operand states in the first two blocks, so those are the blocks with something to learn.

    We reflect once, at the first anchored slice, which in this recipe is the embedding. Reflecting at every slice, as the ex-2.2.1 projection does, would need a detach at every slice, and then only the layers after the last detach would train; reflecting everywhere and detaching only the first edit is the rehearsal the design rejected.

    The stop-gradient does leave one thing open. The blocks after the edit are shared with the clean pass, so the term can reshape how the concept is carried downstream of the edit, including keeping it readable off the axis. That is what the off-axis row (E3) and the margin gate watch.

    **The anti-anchor term.** This is $\mathrm{mean}(\max(-\alpha, 0))$ over the same live positions and slices the anti-subspace term reads, on the clean forward pass only, at a constant weight of 0.1. The reflected states that the fallback term produces are not live positions of that pass, so the two terms do not pull against each other. The term is a hinge on negative alignment: zero when the alignment is positive, and growing linearly as it goes negative. So it keeps clean states out of the half of the space where the fallback lives, and because it acts on one side only, it does not oppose the anchor. The anti-subspace term already penalizes $\alpha^2$ there, so the arms that drop one term or the other say whether the hinge adds anything.

    ### The fallback answer

    Removing the concept operand leaves the visible operand and an unknown partner. The least committal answer is the distribution of the mix over every partner the corpus allows, which we call the *operand-averaged null*. On this grid, each channel of the visible operand has three closed partners, and their three mixes are distinct, so the null is uniform over 27 colors and has no mode.

    Its per-channel median is the mix with the middle partner. That coincides, at every level, with the visible operand mixed with mid-gray (7.5 on the 16-level channel) and rounded to the nearest grid level; `experiment.py` asserts the coincidence. That color is the fallback answer, and it is the gray fallback from M1 carried over.

    The fallback answer depends on the visible operand alone, so it is defined only when that operand is clean. On a red line whose visible operand is itself red (redness ≥ 0.5), both operand states are reflected. The answer would then be the mix with both operands replaced by mid-gray, which is 7.5 on every channel, halfway between grid levels 6 and 9. With nothing visible, the null has no center on the grid; when one operand is visible, its level always breaks the tie. Those 69 lines take no fallback loss and sit outside the gate of H1.

    ### Measurements

    We run one teacher-forced pass per run per intervention, over all 5,832 lines, through the eval contract in [`sca.intervention`](/src/sca/intervention.py). Each pass gives the log-softmax at the `=` position, from which we read the probability on the correct answer and on the fallback answer, the argmax, and the mass outside the color vocabulary.

    Each pass also gives the write per (slice, line, position), as in ex-2.2.1, and the clean alignment map. Fallback accuracy, seed agreement, and the composition all come from the argmax on red lines. The training trajectory records the fallback and anti-anchor losses beside the anchor loss and the margin, every 50 steps.

    **Noise floor.** As in ex-2.2.1: for each group statistic we take the pooled between-seed standard deviation per condition, computed before any comparison is read. A difference between conditions or arms smaller than twice that value is reported as not resolved. Gates score seed means against fixed thresholds and do not use the floor.

    ### Budget

    Twenty-four training runs of the ex-2.1.10 recipe, each at about twice the cost of a plain run (see [Compute](#training)), plus the scoring of twelve stored checkpoints. The scoring is CPU work, at about a second per run per intervention. E6 adds nine fits of a 64×64 matrix, one per no-fallback seed, at a few CPU minutes each.
